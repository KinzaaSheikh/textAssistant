# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A simple text editor with several functionalities including realtime counting and update of both word count and character count. Along with that it can convert the text to either upper case, lower case, or in case you want to take the citation from an all-caps resource, it can also normalize the text for you by making only the first alphabet capital and lower casing the rest.
